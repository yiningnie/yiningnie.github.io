Hello! I am a linguist at the [NYU Department of Linguistics](http://linguistics.as.nyu.edu/), where I received my PhD in May 2020. My dissertation [Licensing arguments](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005283) was supervised by [Alec Marantz](https://wp.nyu.edu/morphlab/alec-marantz/).

Research interests
-----

I specialize in syntax and morphology, especially in the domain of argument structure. My dissertation investigates cross-linguistic differences in argument recursion, which I connect to nominal licensing on the one hand and event structure on the other.

I also have an interest in experimental approaches to syntax and morphology, as well as the morphology-phonology interface.
