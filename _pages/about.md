I specialize in syntax and morphology, especially in the domain of argument structure and event structure, which I investigate through the lens of fieldwork and language acquisition.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin on the ERC-funded project [LeibnizDream](https://leibnizdream.eu) (PIs: Artemis Alexiadou, Uli Sauerland, Maria Teresa Guasti). I completed my PhD in linguistics at New York University in 2020. I received my BA from the University of Cambridge and MA from the University of Toronto.
