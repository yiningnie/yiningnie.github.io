Research interests
-----

I specialize in syntax and morphology, especially in the domain of argument structure. My dissertation investigates cross-linguistic differences in argument recursion, which I connect to nominal licensing on the one hand and event structure on the other.

I also have an interest in experimental approaches to syntax and morphology, as well as the morphology-phonology interface.
