<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
I specialize in syntax and morphology, especially in the domain of argument structure and event structure. I also have an interest in experimental approaches to syntax and morphology, as well as the morphology-phonology interface.

Starting in January 2021, I will be a postdoctoral researcher at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in the [LeibnizDream](https://leibnizdream.eu) project. I completed my PhD in linguistics at New York University in May 2020. I received my BA from the University of Cambridge and MA from the University of Toronto.
