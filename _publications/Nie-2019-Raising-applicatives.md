### Abstract

This paper argues that the thematic introduction of applied arguments and their syntactic licensing are independent components in the syntax of applicative constructions in Tagalog. I present novel data on Tagalog external possession, showing that external possessors and other nominals that remain unlicensed in their thematic position move to the specifier of an athematic raising applicative head (Georgala 2012) in order to be licensed and assigned nominative Case by Voice. The Locative Voice and Circumstantial Voice markers are shown to be two morphological reflexes of the same raising applicative head. The proposed raising applicative analysis, paired with the assumption that Voice is the only source of structural Case in the language, provides an explanation for the high applicative-like behaviour of even apparent low applicative constructions, as well as the obligatory promotion of applied arguments to pivot in Philippine-type voice languages.
