### Abstract

This paper investigates a typological gap in what will be referred to as double case arrays, in which the internal and external arguments of a transitive clause exhibit the same case morphology. Various languages permit NOM-NOM, ACC-ACC and ABS-ABS case arrays, but ERG-ERG constructions are entirely unattested. The aim of the paper is to show that this typological gap should be taken seriously in our theory of ergativity and provide a mechanism for ergative case assignment that is able to derive this gap.
