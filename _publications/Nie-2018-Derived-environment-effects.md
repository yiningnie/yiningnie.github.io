### Abstract

This paper argues that derived environment effects which only apply at morpheme boundaries are non-contrastive processes that are sensitive to <i>prosodic structure</i>. Northern Irish English dentalisation, Turkish velar softening and Finnish assibilation are shown to be subject to prosodic, not morphological, conditioning.
