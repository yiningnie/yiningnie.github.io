### Abstract

The central claim of the dissertation is that the syntactic distribution of arguments depends on abstract nominal licensing. All nominals must be (i) assigned a thematic role (Chomsky, 1981) and (ii) licensed via abstract phi-agreement (Chomsky, 2000, 2001); these requirements hold of nominals in every language, including those with no Case or agreement morphology (Vergnaud, 1977; Sigurðsson, 1989; Sheehan & van der Wal, 2018). Languages differ, however, in their functional vocabulary (Borer, 1984), including which heads are able to assign thematic roles and check phi-features. Every language has Voice (Kratzer, 1996), which introduces and assigns a thematic role to agents, but not every language has Appl, which introduces high applicatives (Pylkkänen, 2002, 2008). Similarly, I propose that Voice is a nominal licenser in every language, but Appl (in languages that have it) is not universally a nominal licenser. In languages where Appl is a licenser, such as Kinyarwanda, all high applied arguments will have their phi-features checked; applied arguments will therefore be able to stack or recurse freely in the clause. In those languages where Appl is not a licenser, such as Zulu and Tagalog, applied arguments must compete for licensing by the Voice head; thus only one applied argument will be able to be licensed, precluding the possibility of applicative recursion in the language. 

Voice plays a privileged role in nominal licensing in being an obligatory licenser (Levin & Massam, 1985; Rezac, 2011) and in delimiting the licensing domain of the clause, such that all nominals must be licensed within VoiceP. I argue that this domain-delimiting status is not an inherent property of the Voice head but only arises when it is the thematic head that is most local to T. More precisely, then, it is Voice under T which defines the licensing domain of the clause. Voice under T is also special in being able to license two arguments: its external argument and an internal argument. Because of its ability to license two arguments, Voice under T is the locus of transitivity alternations, such as the Agent Voice-Patient Voice alternation in Philippine-type voice languages and the ergative-antipassive alternation in ergative languages, and is also responsible for assigning ergative and accusative Case (Legate, 2014). 

While Voice defines licensing domains, events define thematic domains, such that the addition of an event means the addition of a new thematic domain. I demonstrate this using evidence from affixal causative constructions, which languages can form in one of two ways, via (i) the addition of a causer argument (Alexiadou et al., 2006, 2015; Schäfer, 2008; Nie, 2020), or (ii) the addition of a causing event (Harley, 1995, 2013; Pylkkänen, 2008). Languages which allow multiple events in causatives also allow multiple causees, indicating that events define domains of thematic interpretation.
