### Abstract

The functional element <i>kung</i> in Tagalog introduces CPs in various, seemingly disparate contexts. This paper presents a number of constructions where <i>kung</i> can be found, and gives a descriptive overview of their properties. While no concrete analysis is provided of these constructions, some speculation and discussion of relevant previous work is given with the intention of highlighting the data for future work.
